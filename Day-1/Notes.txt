ML Terminologies
	Input/features(X)

	Output/Target(y)


we want to predict the  particular mail is spam or not?
	Yes/No
	1/0
	True/False



prediction employee salary with his experience?
	10K
12K
1L
2L


For example 
we want predict revenue of reliance industries using number of jio subscribers
 

jio subscribers Input/features
Revenue output/target



1. Get the data
	google search
	official websites
	or any other sites provide required data
	we have to generate dummy data with formula(y=mx+c)
	we have to collect manually for required data
	by conducting lottery

2. Pre-processing
	clean the data for required format
	is there any missing values?
	is there invalid values?
	
	i want predict particular person has cancer or not?
		name	Fever
		sai             80
		ram           1000
3. Train model
	a. seperate the features and target
	b. if possible split the data for training and testing
	c. select the algorithm and train the algorithm with  training data

4.Test model
	by using testing we test the model and verify the results ,how it is performing

5. improve the model with different techniques
	1. re train model with different examples
	2. re train model with different features
	3. parameter tuning








we test the student by giving 5 questions


students given 3 correct answers 

performance  = correct answers/ tatal questions

(3*100/5) = 60%



 







you have 10 questions along with answers
you have to test the student how he is performing
in the class we train/teach the students about 5 questions

we conduct exam for the student
	



we Anaconda software with jupyter-notebook


by using jupyter notebook 
	we can do python code   ---> code cell
	we can do the documentation   --> markdown cell




Now we work with dummy csv file for manipulation of data







Tomorrow onwards we provide attendance sheet with you for verify your self
